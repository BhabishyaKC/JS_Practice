// ** Second lesson: variables decleration


// ** VAR
var hello = "bhabishya"
hello = "I will learn javascript with full dedication"
console.log(hello)

// ** LET

let mother = "Bhabishya kc ko mamu "
mother = 'greatest person in the world'
console.log(mother)

// ** CONST  

const message = "Const should be initialized meaning it should be declared initially little different from var and let"
// !!! We cannot do like this below

// message = 'This will throw an error'

console.log(message)
